# Libft
> This repository contains a "Libft" project that is part of the Ã‰cole 42 curriculum.

Libft is the very first project at 42 and requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for more projects ahead.

The intention of this project is to gain greater knowledge and understanding of data structures, basic algorithms and memory management, as well as to solidify the coding logic acquired from the piscine. Additionally, by imposing restrictions on the use of certain libraries and functions in all 42 projects, we can gradually expand our library with more useful functions for the rest of the projects.
